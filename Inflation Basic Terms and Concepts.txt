Basic Terms and concepts
Inflation:
the general level of prices for goods and services rises over time, reducing the purchasing power of money.
a loaf of bread costs ₹50 today and ₹55 next year, that’s a 10% inflation rate
( (55-50) / 50 ) * 100 = 10 % ( 5 rs is 10% of 50 -> price increased = 10%)

 Inflation Terms:
1️⃣ Consumer Price Index (CPI)
measures the average change in prices of a fixed basket of consumer goods/services
most common metric for measuring inflation.
CPI=(Cost of Basket in Current Year/Cost of Basket in Base Year)​×100
f CPI increases from 100 to 110, inflation is 10%.

2️⃣ Core Inflation vs. Headline Inflation
Headline Inflation: Measures inflation including volatile food & energy prices.


Core Inflation: Excludes food & energy prices to show underlying inflation trends.
3️⃣ Producer Price Index (PPI)
Similar to CPI but tracks wholesale prices (prices producers receive).


If PPI rises, it often means CPI will rise soon (because producers pass costs to consumers).
4️⃣ Hyperinflation
Extreme, rapid inflation (e.g., Zimbabwe 2008: Prices doubled every day!).


Usually caused by excessive money printing.
5️⃣ Stagflation
Stagnant economic growth + High Inflation.


Example: 1970s Oil Crisis (economic slowdown + rising prices).

stagflation is an unusual and dangerous economic situation where:
Inflation is high (prices of goods/services keep rising).
Economic growth is stagnant or slow (GDP isn’t growing much).
Unemployment is high (people are losing jobs instead of getting new ones).

This is bad because normally, high inflation happens when the economy is booming (high demand = rising prices). But in stagflation, prices rise even when the economy is struggling and people are out of jobs.

Normally, to fight inflation, central banks increase interest rates. But in stagflation, that makes unemployment even worse, leading to a tough economic dilemma.

6️⃣ Interest Rates & Inflation
Central Banks (like RBI, Fed) control inflation by adjusting interest rates.
If inflation is high, they increase interest rates → loans become expensive → people spend less → inflation drops.
If inflation is too low, they cut interest rates → borrowing/spending increases → economy grows.

Future scope to how It Connects to Our Project
In our inflation dataset, we can check if there were periods of high inflation + slow growth for certain countries.
We can also visualize oil price spikes & their impact on inflation.
1️⃣ CPI Analysis: We’ll examine inflation trends using CPI data.
 2️⃣ Country Comparisons: Identify nations with the highest & lowest inflation.
 3️⃣ Time Series Analysis: Detect patterns (seasonal trends, economic cycles).
 4️⃣ Policy Implications: See how inflation correlates with interest rate changes.
